## _Programming Languages_
--------------------------
Programming languages generally fall into two categories,

1. Compiled
2. Interpreted

Examples of (1) include **C**, **C++** and **OCaml**

Examples of (2) include **Python**, **JavaScript** and **Ruby**

(Java isn't exactly 1 or 2 as it compiles to Java bytecode and
then its interpreted by the JVM)
	  </script>
	</section>

## _Short History of JavaScript_
--------------------------------
The first web browser was called
[**Mosaic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)
and the web itself was made so that physicists could share
research papers. Research papers are static content,
that is they don't change. Think about your HTML,
it doesn't change.

Then businesses discovered the web and immediately interactively was
needed. People needed the websites to do things, to take credit cards,
to animate things, to change the site; for that you need a real
programming language.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Short History of JavaScript, cont..._
-----------------------------------------
There was a race to provide a programming language for the web.
[Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) at NetScape,
now at Mozilla, rushed and in eight days created **JavaScript**.
At the time NetScape was in competition with Microsoft and Microsoft
also created a programming language for the web, it was
called **VBScript**

(Because JavaScript was made in only eight days, the
language has some serious mistakes)

One of the reasons why JavaScript won and VBScript died is the former
is open-source and the latter was closed source. This is why JavaScript is also
known as **EcmaScript**, there is an open spec, standard.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _Engines_
-------------

An engine is another name for an interpreter, remember
that JavaScript is interpreted, not compiled.

The first JavaScript engine, written by Eich, was **SpiderMonkey**, it is
implemented in **C++** and still used in **FireFox**

Today there are quite a few JS engines,

1. SpiderMonkey, used in FireFox
2. Chakra, used in Edge
3. JavaScriptCore, used in Safari, Mobile Safari,
   ReactNative, original version of Chrome
4. V8, created by Google, used in Chrome and the
   foundation of **nodejs**

...and more
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _nodejs_
------------
In this course we will be using **nodejs**, also just known as
**node**, and the latest version of JavaScript called EcmaScript 6 (ES6).
This is so that you know the latest technologies used in Silicon Valley.

**node** was made in 2009 by an amazing programmer named Ryan Dahl,
he basically took **V8**, added an event loop and some low-level IO
calls. Since then the project has taken off and now node is used by
basically all startups and big name users like Groupon, IBM, LinkedIn,
Microsoft, Netflix, PayPal, SAP, Walmart, Yahoo!, Cisco Systems and many more.

We are learning on the latest versions of node,
which support the majority of ES6 (EcmaScript 6). You can play with the
node repl at any time by starting it on the command line:

```
$ node
> var a = 10;
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _Installation notes_
------------------------
node works on all the major platforms, Windows, Linux, OS X; we work on Linux.
if on a Debian or Debian downstream project like Ubuntu you can do:
```
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo bash -
$ sudo aptitude install nodejs -y
```

we also use the `Atom` text editor

```
$ wget https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/download/v1.10.2/atom-amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i atom-amd64.deb
$ sudo npm install tern -g
$ apm install react atom-ternjs
```
Then you can make JavaScript programs by making a JavaScript file with `Atom`
```
$ atom code.js
```
And run the code:
```
$ node code.js
```

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: variables_
-----------------
Every programming language has **variables**. A variable, also called
an identifier, is way to refer to data in memory. Fundamental data types
in JavaScript include **String**, **Boolean**, **Number** and others.

Note that comments, aka non runnable code, start with **//**

Example:

```
// Creates a variable called a with the data 123, the type of
// a is Number
var a = 123;

// Creates a variable called name with the data 'Student'
// the type of name is String
var name = 'Student';
```

**NOTE** Every language also has `keywords`, these are words that you cannot use
as identifiers, they are reserved for the language itself, examples: `if`, `for`,
`var`, `function`, and more.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: variables cont..._
-----------------------------------
Notice that we variables that we created started with `var`
In ES6, EcmaScript 6, we have three ways of declaring variables.

<br/>

```
var a = 10;
const b = 'hello';
let g = true;
```

<br/>

What is the difference between the three?
For that we need to talk about scope.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: scope_
-----------------------
Scope is a fundamental idea in all programming languages and its especially
important in JavaScript. It basically means where its legal to use a variable.
In ES6 scopes are introduced by `blocks`, some examples of things that
introduce blocks include conditionals, loops, and functions.

```
// imagine that this file is called prog.js
if (true) {
  var name = '123';
}
// we can print anything to the terminal screen with console.log
console.log(name);
```
if we run this code:
```
$ node prog.js
```
Then we'll see that '123' is printed to the screen. Here we say that the conditional leaks
scope, the variable `name` is escaping the scope.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: scope cont..._
-------------------------------
Now if we try using `let`, then we'll see a difference:
```
// imagine that this file is called prog.js
if (true) {
  let name = '123';
}
// we can print anything to the terminal screen with console.log
console.log(name);
```
if we run this code:
```
$ node prog.js
```
Then we get an `exception`, a fatal error not handled by you
```

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: scope cont..._
-------------------------------
As programmers we ALWAYS need to read the error messages. The error message here
tells you that the variable is not defined, that is, its not in scope. Why? Because
we created the variable `name` with `let` and variables created with `let` are
scoped to the `block` in which they are created. that is, you're only allowed
to use that variable in the block that you created it in.

Another example:
```
// Silly for loop.
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
console.log(i)
```
Here we make a variable `i` which we made only to do a loop three times
but its still accessible, usable outside the `for` loop.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: scope cont..._
-------------------------------
We always want to scope variables as close as possible to their usage,
their actual needs. Another modifier is `const`. Now we need to talk
about mutation.
```
let a = 'Karen';
a = 'Հասմիկ';
```
What happened? We changed, we **mutated**, the variable from the string 'Karen'
to the new string 'Հասմիկ'. Also notice that we only have to use the `let` modifier
the first time we make the variable. What if we don't want the variable to change?
For that we use `const`
```
const a = 'Karen';
a = 'Հասմիկ';
```
`exception`:
```
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
  at repl:1:3
  at realRunInThisContextScript (vm.js:22:35)
  at sigintHandlersWrap (vm.js:98:12)
  at ContextifyScript.Script.runInThisContext (vm.js:24:12)
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: scope cont..._
--------------------------------
So `const` is like `let` semantically, aka the meaning of how its used
and scoping but with the additional benefit that variables made with
`const` are not allowed to be reassigned. The final one, `var`, is function scoped.

It is important to understand this fundamental concept of scope.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: control structure_
-----------------------------------
Now we will talk about control structure, for the moment we will focus on
synchronous code, that is code that executes top to down. That is node will read
your code from the beginning to end and do everything that you tell it to do.

We've seen two control structures already, the `if` conditional and the `for` loop.

```
// Inside the () needs to be a boolean expression
// something that evaluates to true or false.
if (10 > 5) {
  console.log('Hello world');
}
```
`for` loops
```
for (let j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
  console.log(j + 5);
}
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _JavaScript: control structure cont..._
-------------------------------------------
Control structures help us structure, organize our code, which way
it should 'go', what it should do.

The conditional can also take an `else`
```
if (5 < 3) {
  console.log('This is impossible);
} else {
  console.log('Of course 5 is not less than 3');
}
```
Another loop construct is the `while` control structure.
```
let i = 0;
while (i < 4) {
  console.log('Keep talking');
  // i++ is short for i = i + 1;
  i++
}
```
