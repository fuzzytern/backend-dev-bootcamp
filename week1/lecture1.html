# Introduction to Linux, shell, git.

## _Operating Systems_
-------------------
Operating systems are what control our computers, you might know a few
by name like _Windows_, _OS X_, and _Linux_

We're going to be working with Linux, specifically Ubuntu inside of 
VirtualBox running on Windows.

Operating systems control our computers, they ultimately control 
the hardware, that is the physical parts of the computer and they
control what instruction, (command), the CPU execs.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Why Linux (Ubuntu)?_
------------------------

We are learning Linux because

1. If you're going to be a serious programmer, then you need to know it.

2. Over 95% of all servers are running Linux, basically every website,
   every "cloud" service.

3. It is fundamental, the foundation of open source software

4. If you start a company, you will need a backend, those backends run Linux.

	  </script>

	  <script type="text/template">
### _Goals of the course?_
--------------------------------------------------

1. ...be comfortable with _Linux_

2. ...understand _git_ since most tools and code are distributed via _git_

3. ...know modern `JavaScript` _deeply_

4. ...create projects from scratch on your own

5. ...understand `nodejs`, `async` programming

	   ### _Linux terminology_
	   -----------------------
	   Operating systems are divided into `kernelspace` and `userspace`.
	   Kernelspace is what the kernel controls, that basically hardware, the CPU,
	   anything physical, your programs run in userspace and must ask the kernel
	   with `system` calls for anything physical. Programs are also sometimes called
	   binaries, processes or executables.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
	   ### _Linux terminology_

	   You can imagine it like this:
	   ```
	   ---------------------------------------------
	   |                                           |
	   |  `userspace`, like `git`, `nano`, `node`. |
	   |                                           |
	   |           ------------------              |
	   |          |                  |             |
	   |          |   kernelspace    |             |
	   |          |                  |             | 
	   |          |                  |             |
	   |           ------------------              |
	   ---------------------------------------------
	   ```
	   In reality is more about a separation of memory/RAM.

### _Linux Terminology cont..._
The Linux source code, located [here](https://github.com/torvalds/linux), is 
about 20 million lines of `C` code. Userland programs can be written in 
any program. Binaries (remember its another name for programs) on Linux 
are organized differently than on `Windows` or `OS X`. For example, on Windows
programs end with `.exe`, but on Linux programs don't need to have that extension.
Linux programs are organized in the
[`ELF`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) format.
	  </script>

### _Linux Terminology cont..._
The combination of the kernel and userspace makes up a `GNU/Linux`
distribution. Popular distributions include `Ubuntu`, `Debian`, 
`Mint`, `Fedora`, `CentOS` and more.

### _NOTE_
```
Sometimes you'll hear the terms upstream and downstream of projects.
A downstream project is one that is built on top of another project, 
the upstream project, so Ubuntu is downstream of Debian

```
	  </script>

### _Starting with the shell_
-----------------------------

The `shell` is the primary way we'll communicate with 
the Operating System. Shell, terminal, bash, and command line 
all basically mean the same thing in this course.
The shell maintains some **state** 

### _NOTE_
```
State is another name for data that changes, 
when we change that data we say that we mutated some state
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _file system_
Within the shell, we can move about the file system. You
can imagine the file system like a tree:

```
                    -----
                   |  /  |
                    -----
                  /       \ 
             ------       ------
            | home |     |  usr | 
             ------       ------
           /             /
     --------        --------       
    | coding |      | coding |
     --------        --------
```
An important concept is called a **Path**, there are two
kinds of paths **Absolute Paths** and **Relative Paths**

Examples of Absolute path: /usr/home/coding

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _file system cont..._
-----------------
Examples of Absolute path: /usr/home/coding

Example of Relative path: usr/coding

Notice that an absolute path must always start from the beginning
of the file sytem, at **/**

With absolute paths, there can be no ambiguity about where the 
file is on the file system, but with relative paths there an be 
ambiguity.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _file system + bash_
------------------------
With `bash` running, we can navigate the file system.

### _NOTE_
Examples like
```
$ pwd
```
mean do it at the shell prompt, put in the command pwd.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _file system + bash cont..._
--------------------------------
In the shell there are some important commands that we'll use 
over and over again.

Note that `<some_path_here>` is not the thing you type, its a 
placeholder for what you'll put in.

**This changes your directory to another directory**
```
$ cd <some_path_here>
```

**This prints out the contents of the current directory**
```
$ ls
```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
	   ### _file system + bash cont..._
	   --------------------------------
	   **You can also give ls a path, can be absolute or relative**
	   ```
	   $ ls /usr/include
	   ```
	   ** Find the directory of a file **
	   ```
	   $ dirname /usr/include/stdlib.h
	   ```
	   ** The shell also can do commands out of turn, 
	   aka not left to right. This says to do `dirname` first, 
	   then give the result to ls
	   **
	   ```
	   $ ls $(dirname /usr/include)
	   ```
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
	   ### _making shell scripts_
	   --------------------------
	   We can also automate some of this shell coding.
	   The shell also has a concept of `for loops`, `while loops`
	   For example, imagine this file is called `printout.sh`

	   ```
	   #!/bin/bash
	   for i in $(seq 8); do 
	       mkdir week-${i}
	   done
	   ```

	   This script can be run like: 
	   ```
	   $ bash printout.sh
	   ``` 
	   and it will make 8 directories.
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
	   ### _making shell scripts_
	   --------------------------
	   
	   We can also make the shell script file called `printout.sh` behave 
	   as if was a separate program by using `chmod`.

	   ````
	   $ chmod +x printout.sh
	   ```

	   Then we can use it like any other program
	   
	   ```
	   $ ./printout.sh
	   ```

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
### _git (Version Control)_
---------
When we work on software we need a way to track the code, 
a way to change it carefully and be able to work on a team, aka 
other programmers. This kind of tool is called version control.

There are a few well known version control tools, some famous ones:

1. `git` 2. `hg` 3. `darcs` 4. `cvs` 5. `svn`

We will use (1), `git`.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
	   ### _git (Version Control)_
	   ---------
	   We will do our work on [github](http://github.com)
	   Github is a business built on top of github, it is free to 
	   have an account there. Everyone must have an account on `github`.

	   We use git to make `commits`, a good commit should be self contained
	   and have a good commit message. A good commit message is in the present 
	   tense and describes what work is in the commit.
